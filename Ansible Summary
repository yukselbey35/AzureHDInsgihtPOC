Configure the ansible User on the Control Node
Next, we'll configure the ansible user on the control node for ssh shared key access to managed nodes.

Note: Do not use a passphrase for the key pair.

Create a key pair for the ansible user on the control host, accepting the defaults when prompted:

sudo su - ansible
ssh-keygen
Copy the public key to both node1 and node2:

ssh-copy-id node1
ssh-copy-id node2

#Created inventory file.
all:
  hosts:
    node1.myserver.com
  children: # allow us to create groups under all 
    httpd: #created the httpd group so we can run with ansible command => ansible httpd -i inventory.yaml 
      hosts:
        node2.myserver.com
        node3.myserver.com
    labservers: # ansible -i inv.yaml labservers -m setup
      hosts:
        node[2:6].myserver.com
  
#Creating Dynamic inventory
# Use chmod +x dynamic.sh to make executable file
$. dynamic.sh --list
$ansible all -i dynamic.sh -m ping
