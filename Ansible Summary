Configure the ansible User on the Control Node
Next, we'll configure the ansible user on the control node for ssh shared key access to managed nodes.

Note: Do not use a passphrase for the key pair.

Create a key pair for the ansible user on the control host, accepting the defaults when prompted:

sudo su - ansible
ssh-keygen
Copy the public key to both node1 and node2:

ssh-copy-id node1
ssh-copy-id node2
